# movie_recommender
Simple Item Based Movie Recommender 


This Recommender is based on Movie Lens 1M Dataset. 

When you have downloaded data, here are a several things to fix: 
        - Users DataFrame should have columns: "user_id", "gender", "age".
        - Since movies were mostly entered by hand, there were many errors and inconsistencies. Should be fixed by hand.
        - Ratings DataFrame should have columns: "user_id", "movie_id", "rating".
